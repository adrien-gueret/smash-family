## Game components

1 deck of 60 cards, common to both players.  
This deck has 20 different cards, each in 3 copies.

## Start of the game

1. Shuffle the deck.
2. Each player draws 4 cards.
3. The 3 cards at the top of the deck are drawn. The first one is put face down and the other two face up.
	* If both visible cards are identical, group them and draw another card until two different cards are visible.

## Flow of the game

11. Each player keeps cards from families she/he has completed: these cards are **not** going back to the deck for next rounds.
12. If a player has 10 cards or more, she/he has won! If both players reach this score at the same time, the one with the most cards wins. If there is a tie, it is a draw.
13. If nobody won, we shuffle the remaining cards in the deck and a new round starts.

## Player's turn
